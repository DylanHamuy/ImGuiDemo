# ImGuiDemo
A speedrun project I made for an Activision interview. The purpose was to get myself familiar with Dear ImGui, metal, and improve my understanding of C++. It is a quick build of a hypothetical game's UI. My favorite part is the health bar because it functions exaclty like Overawatch's health bar.
